# Forest-Fire-Prediction
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict forest fire occurrences. The dataset includes various features such as elevation, aspect, slope, and distances to water bodies, roads, and fire points. The target variable is the type of forest cover, which indicates the likelihood of a forest fire
